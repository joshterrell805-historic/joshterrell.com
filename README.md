On the admin side (the side you can't see unless you've installed and configured it), [joshterrell.com](https://joshterrell.com) includes a markdown editor for editing documents. The top is the actions bar including actions for preview/edit, unlock/lock, and delete.
The title is editable using html5's `contenteditable`, and the rest is the body represented in markdown (editable with vim interface). All changes are commited to the database as they are made, so there is no need to save (no version control at the moment).
